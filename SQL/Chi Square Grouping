# Chi Square Grouping
# Goal: 
  # Generate four distinct groups based on exposure status and export data for chi square analysis
# Note:
  # Schema and columns renamed to protect origin privacy
# Definitions:
  # Converters = users who committed the action in question
  # Dropped = users who were exposed and did not covert
